                <h3>Comparisons</h3>
                10/10 &starf;, I'm from Scotland and loved the British "Office". But I adore the American version! Steve Carell leads a great cast and I'm not surprised it has lasted so long. 
                I'm working my way through Series 3 and have series 4 and 5 to look forward to. It's amazing how much the writers can get into 20 minutes. I like it when there is a double episode. I too am so glad there is no laughter track (which has stopped me watching quite a few comedy shows). I have noticed in this third series that the camera can be very annoying when it whizzes from character to character - far too quickly. Completely unnecessary. Steve's "Michael" conveys so much about the character - he's full of himself but so vulnerable and anxious for friends. Rainn Wilson's "Dwight" is just brilliant. And I love the company name - "Dunder Mifflin"!</li>

                <h3>My favourite sitcom EVER!!</h3>
                10/10 &starf;, Honestly, I thought show as 'boring' even before I watched a single episode. Seriously, what interesting could happen in an office environment? 
                I remember first scene I saw from this show. It was from an internet wallpaper with Michael Scott with a white board behind him saying 
                "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take".
                Then after years from that, I somehow started watching "The Office", I don't really remember why I did that. 
                What I love most about this show is it's raw nature. The camera is kind of shaky yet still brings the best scenes...something that I had never seen before in a TV sitcom. 
                It may seem less professional but adds real life, personal touch with the TV show and the characters in them.
                Obviously, Michael Scott is one of my favourite character. Jim, Andy, Dwight, Pam, Erin, Kevin, Oscar, Angela, Creed and even the camera crew include in my favourite list.
                What I learned from this show is that it's okay to be weird and different ,that you won't be welcomed as you wanted it to be ( remembering Michael Scott attempts ), 
                that you can't wait and expect things to happen for you, that it's okay to be hated and feel hate to others....it's all dependent on time. People change, feelings change, situations change. 
                All you got to do is be yourself and be true to your heart and everything will fall into it's place.
                I love every minute I spent on this show &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;

                <h3>Easily one of the best shows of all time!</h3>
                9/10 &starf;, So much to relate too. All the characters, they all had their place, and they all nailed it. Maybe Micheal was a little bit too over the top at times, but your love to hate him is what made him such a good person for the role.

                The best part is I felt something of a personal attachment to some of the characters. Really rooting for some, but also rooting against other, and really loving to hate some of the quirky characters. And when the show is all said and done, you love them all. I miss them.
                
                Easily re-watchable. This is a classic. This one will be played out in VR I'm sure when were all plugged into some computer.

                <h3>Obviously the best sitcom!!!</h3>
                10/10 &starf;, This is the most remarkable and hilarious workplace comedy created in this decade unarguably. I watched all the first 7 seasons inside a few days and I wondered how this show kept me so relaxed and wanting more and more from these characters as the story lines kept me hooked on the ever changing plot. The writers have marvellously twisted the flow of the show adding suspense, a little bit of drama and romance and a whole lot of insanely funny pranks, jokes and it really bond us with the characters. And something I felt unique about this show is that how we felt for Michael when he was desperate with his life although we hated him when he was a nuisance and he added something to the show that I find unexplainable.
                So this is one heck of a show and I recently found that Billie eilish had watched this show 12 times! (worth it).

                <h3>Surpasses the brilliant original.</h3>
                7/10 &starf;, After reading all of the horrible reviews coming from the UK, I felt the strong desire to comment. I learned that most of the reviewers bashing it have only seen a few (at most) episodes from the first season - many haven't seen it at all, and are simply bashing it because of an overwhelming sense of pride in the original. I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth.
                This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty. The casts of the US and UK versions love each show. Ricky Gervais even wrote and executive produced a few episodes of the US version. Open your minds, people! Most of the US fans KNOW that it's based on a British version. It has gotten the credit it deserves for being a brilliant and hilarious show.
                But the American version is also brilliant and hilarious. I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version.
                I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable.
                As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with.
                This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much. These three shows get better with each viewing and are great because there's so many levels of humor, from the apparent outrageousness to the minute details that are noticed after repeated viewings and are often funnier than the surface material.

                <h3>Excellent! I want more, more, more please...</h3>
                10/10 &starf;, I saw Ricky Gervais' British first version of The Office first and I really liked it. I was septic that there was going to be an American version and I completely zapped it because of that. So it's only in 2016 that I thought I give the American version a shot and oh am I pleased I did that. I loved it so much I watched the entire nine seasons in only a month. I was completely addicted to it, so I was actually sad that they wrote this series off because to me it could stayed on forever. It's just an excellent show. I mean, if there are people that don't think this show is funny then they just don't have the right sense of humor. Every single character brings it's own touch to the show and they are all good. The pranks between Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute are a delight to watch. The 9 to 5 I-don't-care-about-anything office mentality from Stanley Hudson is just so recognizable. Kevin Malone and his craving for food, with his nerdy look, is just hilarious. Michael Scott, the man I would absolutely hate in real life, is so irritating in his character but yet so funny to watch. Andy Bernard, the guy that just don't get it but that desperately tries. Pam Beesly, one of the only "normal" people in the office, her flirting with Jim, also a delight to watch. Meredith Palmer, the slut of the office, every office has one of those, lovely to watch. The eternal love-hate relationship between Kelly Kapoor and Ryan Howard. The poor poor Toby Flenderson, hated by almost everybody in the office, even though he tries to do his best to please every-one. Angela Martin, she acts like a nun but deeply she's completely different. Oscar Martinez, the gay of the office, also one of the "normal" people from the office. Phyllis Vance from Vance refrigeration, a name I will always think about when I see refrigerators. Darryl Philbin, great to watch as well. I really loved every character in this series, but my favorites are Dwight, Kevin, Darryl and Michael. I love the way of filming. A bit like in Parks and Recreation, where as soon as the character says a punchline he stares at you into the camera for a couple of seconds. Just love that kind of cinema. It works really well to make it funny. Anyways, I'm so sad it's finished. If you never saw it I can only recommend it. You won't be sorry.
